Time Series Data Generation using Deep Learning (TimeGAN)
This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for time series data preprocessing, forecasting, and synthetic data generation using deep learning ‚Äî particularly the TimeGAN model. The primary objective is to transform raw time series data into a stationary form, perform classical forecasting with ARIMA, and generate realistic synthetic time series using TimeGAN. A GUI was also developed for visualizing and evaluating real vs. synthetic data.

Workflow Overview
1. Data Preprocessing
Loaded and scaled data using MinMaxScaler

Checked for stationarity with ADF test

Applied rolling mean, differencing, and smoothing

Visualized ACF and PACF plots to identify temporal dependencies

2. Forecasting with ARIMA
Fitted ARIMA models to preprocessed data

Evaluated performance using MAE, MSE, and AIC metrics

3. Synthetic Generation with TimeGAN
Used ydata-synthetic TimeSeriesSynthesizer

Configured model and training parameters for GAN

Generated synthetic sequences mimicking the real dataset

4. Evaluation of Synthetic Data
KDE plots comparing real vs. synthetic distributions

Autocorrelation and PACF diagnostics

Histogram & scatter comparisons

Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) to check embedding quality
